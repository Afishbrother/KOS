Increase the action groups available to kOS from 10 to 250 and add the ability to edit actions in flight and the ability to name action groups so you describe what a group does.

Includes a Script Trigger action that can be used to control a running program and visual feedback if an action group is currently activated.

Works via adding the AG11 through AG250 bindings that behave the same as the AG1 through AG10 bindings in base kOS.
