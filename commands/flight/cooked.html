<p>In this style of controlling the craft, you do not steer the craft directly, but instead select a goal direction and let kOS pick the way to steer toward that goal. This method of controlling the craft consists primarily of the following two commands:</p>
<span class="target" id="lock-throttle"></span><dl class="object">
<dt>
<tt class="descname">LOCK THROTTLE TO value.</tt></dt>
<dd><p>This sets the main throttle of the ship to <em>value</em>. Where <em>value</em> is a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0. A value of 0.0 means the throttle is idle, and a value of 1.0 means the throttle is at maximum. A value of 0.5 means the throttle is at the halfway point, and so on.</p>
</dd></dl>

<span class="target" id="lock-steering"></span><dl class="object">
<dt>
<tt class="descname">LOCK STEERING TO value.</tt></dt>
<dd><p>This sets the direction <strong>kOS</strong> should point the ship where <em>value</em> is a <a class="reference internal" href="../../math/vector.html#structure:VECTOR" title="VECTOR structure"><tt class="xref ks ks-struct docutils literal"><span class="pre">Vector</span></tt></a> or a <a class="reference internal" href="../../math/direction.html#direction"><em>Direction</em></a> created from a <a class="reference internal" href="../../math/direction.html#rotation"><em>Rotation</em></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../../math/direction.html#heading"><em>Heading</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><a class="reference internal" href="../../math/direction.html#rotation"><em>Rotation</em></a></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A Rotation expressed as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">R(pitch,yaw,roll)</span></tt>. Note that pitch, yaw and roll are not based on the horizon, but based on an internal coordinate system used by <strong>KSP</strong> that is hard to use. Thankfully, you can force the rotation into a sensible frame of reference by adding a rotation to a known direction first.</p>
<p>To select a direction that is 20 degrees off from straight up:</p>
<div class="highlight-c"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">LOCK</span> <span class="n">STEERING</span> <span class="n">TO</span> <span class="n">Up</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">R</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">).</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To select a direction that is due east, aimed at the horizon:</p>
<div class="highlight-c"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">LOCK</span> <span class="n">STEERING</span> <span class="n">TO</span> <span class="n">North</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">R</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">).</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">UP</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NORTH</span></tt> are the only two predefined rotations.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../math/direction.html#heading"><em>Heading</em></a></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A heading expressed as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HEADING(compass,</span> <span class="pre">pitch)</span></tt>. This will aim 30 degrees above the horizon, due south:</p>

</pre></div>

</div></blockquote>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../math/vector.html#structure:VECTOR" title="VECTOR structure"><tt class="xref ks ks-struct docutils literal"><span class="pre">Vector</span></tt></a></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Any vector can also be used to lock steering:</p>
<div class="highlight-c"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">LOCK</span> <span class="n">STEERING</span> <span class="n">TO</span> <span class="n">V</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">).</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that the internal coordinate system for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(X,Y,Z)</span></tt> is quite complex to explain. To aim in the opposite of the surface velocity direction:</p>
<div class="highlight-c"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">LOCK</span> <span class="n">STEERING</span> <span class="n">TO</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">SHIP</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">VELOCITY</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">SURFACE</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The following aims at a vector which is the cross product of velocity and direction down to the SOI planet - in other words, it aims at the &#8220;normal&#8221; direction to the orbit:</p>
<div class="highlight-c"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">LOCK</span> <span class="n">STEERING</span> <span class="n">TO</span> <span class="n">VCRS</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">SHIP</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">VELOCITY</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">ORBIT</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">BODY</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">POSITION</span><span class="p">).</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
</dd></dl>

<p>Like all <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LOCK</span></tt> expressions, the steering and throttle continually update on their own when using this style of control. If you lock your steering to velocity, then as your velocity changes, your steering will change to match it. Unlike with other <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LOCK</span></tt> expressions, the steering and throttle are special in that the lock expression gets executed automatically all the time in the background, while other <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LOCK</span></tt> expressions only get executed when you try to read the value of the variable. The reason is that the <strong>kOS</strong> computer is constantly querying the lock expression multiple times per second as it adjusts the steering and throttle in the background.</p>
<div class="section" id="unlocking-controls">

<p>If you <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LOCK</span></tt> the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">THROTTLE</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">STEERING</span></tt>, be aware that this prevents the user from manually controlling them. Until they unlock, the manual controls are prevented from working. You can free up the controls by issuing these two commands:</p>

<span class="n">UNLOCK</span> <span class="n">THROTTLE</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When the program ends, these automatically unlock as well, which means that to control a craft you must make sure the program doesn&#8217;t end. The moment it ends it lets go of the controls.</p>

</div>
<p>While cooked steering tries to come balanced to perform decently without user
interaction, there are some instances where you may need to help tune the
behavior.  There are a number of settings you can adjust to tweak the
behavior of the cooked steering if it&#8217;s not performing exactly as you&#8217;d
like.  It may be the case that making your own control mechanism from
scratch, while entirely possible with kOS, might be unnecessary if all
you really want to do is just make the cooked steering behave slightly
differently.</p>
<p>The adjustments described below all come from the

<h3>Some simple suggestions to try fixing common problems<a class="headerlink" href="#some-simple-suggestions-to-try-fixing-common-problems" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to understand the intricate details of the cooked
steering system, here&#8217;s some quick suggestions for changes to the
settings that might help solve some problems, in the list below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>problem</strong>: A large vessel with low torque doesn&#8217;t seem to be even trying to
rotate very quickly.  The controls may be fluctuating around the zero point,
but it doesn&#8217;t seem to want to even try to turn faster.<ul>
<li><strong>solution</strong>: Increase <cite>STEERINGMANAGER:MAXSTOPPINGTIME</cite> to about 5 or
10 seconds or so.  Also, slightly increase <cite>STEERINGMANAGER:PITCHPID:KD</cite>
and <cite>STEERINGMANAGER:YAWPID:KD</cite> to about 1 or 2 as well to go with it.</li>
<li><strong>explanation</strong>: Once the steering manager gets such a ship rotating at
a tiny rate, it stops trying to make it rotate any faster than that
because it&#8217;s &#8220;afraid&#8221; of allowing it to obtain a larger momentum than it
thinks it could quickly stop.  It needs to be told that in this case
it&#8217;s okay to build up more &#8220;seconds worth&#8221; of rotational velocity.  The
reason for increasing the Kd term as well is to tell it to anticipate
the need to starting slowing down rotation sooner than it normally
would.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>problem</strong>: A vessel seems to reasonably come to the desired direction
sensibly, but once it&#8217;s there the ship vibrates back and forth by about 1
degree or less excessively around the setpoint.<ul>
<li><strong>solution</strong>: Increase <cite>STEERINGMANAGER:PITCHTS</cite> and
<cite>STEERINGMANAGER:YAWTS</cite> to several seconds.</li>
<li><strong>explanation</strong>: Once it&#8217;s
at the desired orientation and it has mostly zeroed the rotational
velocity, it&#8217;s trying to hold it there with microadjustments to the
controls, and those microadjustments are &#8220;too tight&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>problem</strong>: The vessel&#8217;s nose seems to be waving slowly back and forth
across the set direction, taking too long to center on it, and you notice
the control indicators are pushing all the way to the extremes as it does
so.<ul>
<li><strong>solution</strong>: Increase <cite>STEERINGMANAGER:PITCHPID:KD</cite> and
<cite>STEERINGMANGER:YAWPID:KD</cite>.</li>
<li><strong>explanation</strong>: The ship is <em>trying</em> to
push its rotation rate too high when almost at the setpoint.  It needs
to anticipate the fact that it is going to reach the desired direction
and start slowing down BEFORE it gets there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>problem</strong>: The vessel&#8217;s nose seems to be waving slowly back and forth across
the set direction, taking too long to center on it, but you notice that the
control indicators are NOT pushing all the way to the extremes as it does
so.  Instead they seem to be staying low in magnitude, wavering around zero
and may be getting smaller over time.<ul>
<li><strong>solution</strong>: Decrease <cite>STEERINGMANAGER:PITCHTS</cite> and/or
<cite>STEERINGMANAGER:YAWTS</cite></li>
<li><strong>explanation</strong>: While larger values for the
settling time on the Torque PID controller will help to smooth out
spikes in the controls, it also results in a longer time period before
the steering comes to a rest at the setpoint (also knows as settling).
If you had previously increased the settling time to reduce
oscillations, try picking a value half way between the default and the
new value you previously selected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But to understand how to tune the cooked steering in a more complex way than
just with that simple list, you first have to understand what a PID controller
is, at least a little bit, so you know what the settings you can tweak
actually do.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what a PID controller is and want to learn more, you can
read numerous descriptions of the concept on the internet that can be found
in moments by a web search.  If you just want to know a two minute explanation
for the sake of tuing the cooked steering a bit, read on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="quick-and-dirty-description-of-a-pid-controller">
<h3>Quick and Dirty description of a PID controller<a class="headerlink" href="#quick-and-dirty-description-of-a-pid-controller" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>You can think of a PID controller as a magic mathematical black box that can
learn where to set a control lever in order to achieve a given goal.  A good
example of this is cruise control on a car.  You tell the cruise control
what speed you&#8217;d like it to maintain, and it attempts to move the accelerator
pedal to the necessary position that will maintain that constant speed.</p>
<p>That, in a nutshell is the goal of a PID controller - to perform tasks
like that.  You have control over a lever or dial of some sort, and it
indirectly affects a phenomenon you can measure, and you feed the
mathematical black box of the PID controller the measurement of the
phenomenon, and obey its instructions of where to set the control lever.
Over time, the PID controller, under the assumption that you are obeying
its instructions of where to set the control lever, learns how to fine
tune its commands about how to set the lever to get the measurement to
settle on the value you asked for.</p>
<p>A more complex discussion of PID controllers than that is outside the
scope of this document, but you can check out <a class="reference internal" href="../../tutorials/pidloops.html#pidloops"><em>the PID Loop tutorial.</em></a></p>

<p>The first PID controller looks at the current direction the ship is pointed,
versus the direction the ship is meant to be pointed, and uses the offset
between the two to decide how to set the desired rotational velocity (rate
at which the angle is changing).</p>
<p>The suffixes to <a class="reference internal" href="../../structures/misc/steeringmanager.html#steeringmanager"><em>SteeringManager</em></a> allow direct
manipulation of the rotational velocity&#8217;s PID tuning parameters.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-torque-pid">
<span id="cooked-torque-pid"></span><h4>The Torque PID<a class="headerlink" href="#the-torque-pid" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>But there is no such thing as a lever that directly controls the rotational
velocity.  What there is, is a lever that directly controls the rotational
<em>acceleration</em>.  When you pull on the yoke (i.e. hold down the &#8220;S&#8221; key),
you are telling the ship to either rotate <em>faster</em>  or <em>slower</em> than it
already is.</p>
<p>So given a result from the Rotational Velocity PID, with a desired
rotational velocity to seek, the second PID controller takes over,
the Torque PID, which uses that information to choose how to set
the actual controls themselves (i.e. the WASDQE controls) to accelerate
toward that goal rotational velocity.</p>
<p>The suffixes to <a class="reference internal" href="../../structures/misc/steeringmanager.html#steeringmanager"><em>SteeringManager</em></a> don&#8217;t quite
allow direct manipulation of the torque PID tuning parameters Kp, Ki,
and Kd, because they are calculated indirectly from the ship&#8217;s own
attributes.  However, there are several suffixes to
<a class="reference internal" href="../../structures/misc/steeringmanager.html#steeringmanager"><em>SteeringManager</em></a> that allow you to make
indirect adjustments to them that are used in calculating the values
it uses for Kp, Ki, and Kd.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This technique of using two different PID controllers, the first one
telling the second one which seek value to use, and the second one
actually being connected to the control &#8220;lever&#8221;, is one of many ways of dealing
with a phenomenon with two levels of indirection from the control.</p>
<p>Keeping the above two things separate, the rotational velocity PID
versus the Torque PID, is important in knowing which setting
you need to tweak in order to achieve the desired effect.</p>

<h4>One pair of PID&#8217;s per axis of rotation<a class="headerlink" href="#one-pair-of-pid-s-per-axis-of-rotation" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>The above pair of controllers is replicated per each of the 3 axes of
rotation, for a total of 6 altogether.  Some of the settings you can
adjust affect all 3 axes together, while others are specific to just
one.  See the descriptions of each setting carefully to know which is
which.</p>

<div class="section" id="corrects-2-axes-first-then-the-3rd">
<h4>Corrects 2 axes first, then the 3rd<a class="headerlink" href="#corrects-2-axes-first-then-the-3rd" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>The cooked steering tries to correct first the pitch and yaw, to aim
the rocket at the desired pointing vector, then only after it&#8217;s very
close to finishing that task does it allow the 3rd axis, the roll axis,
to correct itself.  This is because if you try correcting all three at
the same time, it causes the cooked steering to describe a curved arc
toward its destination orientation, rather than rotating straight
towards it.</p>
<p>This behavior is correct for rockets with radial symmetry, but is
probably a bit wrong for trying to steer an airplane to a new heading
while in atmosphere.  For flying an airplane to a new heading, it&#8217;s
still best to make your own control scheme from scratch with raw steering.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-settings-to-change">
<h4>The settings to change<a class="headerlink" href="#the-settings-to-change" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>First, you can modify how kOS decides how fast the ship should turn:</p>
<div class="highlight-c"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// MAXSTOPPINGTIME tells kOS how to calculate the maximum allowable</span>
<span class="c1">// angular velocity the Rotational Velocity PID is allowed to output.</span>
<span class="c1">// Increasing the value will result in the ship turning</span>
<span class="c1">// faster, but it may introduce more overshoot.</span>
<span class="c1">// Adjust this setting if you have a small amount of torque on a large mass,</span>
<span class="c1">// or if your ship appears to oscillate back and forth rapidly without</span>
<span class="c1">// moving towards the target direction.</span>
<span class="n">SET</span> <span class="n">STEERINGMANAGER</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">MAXSTOPPINGTIME</span> <span class="n">TO</span> <span class="mf">10.</span>

<span class="c1">// You can also modify the PID constants that calculate desired angular</span>
<span class="c1">// velocity based on angular error, in the angular velocity PID controller.</span>
<span class="c1">// Note that changes made directly to the PIDLoop&#39;s MINIMUM and MAXIMUM</span>
<span class="c1">// suffixes will be overwritten based on the value MAXSTOPPINGTIME, the</span>
<span class="c1">// ship&#39;s torque and moment of inertia.</span>
<span class="c1">// These values will require precision and testing to ensure consistent</span>
<span class="c1">// performance.</span>
<span class="c1">// Beware of large KD values: Due to the way angular velocity and part</span>
<span class="c1">// facing directions are calculated in KSP, it is normal to have small rapid</span>
<span class="c1">// fluctuations which may introduce instability in the derivative component.</span>
<span class="n">SET</span> <span class="n">STEERINGMANAGER</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">PITCHPID</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">KP</span> <span class="n">TO</span> <span class="mf">0.85</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="n">SET</span> <span class="n">STEERINGMANAGER</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">PITCHPID</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">KI</span> <span class="n">TO</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="p">.</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Second, you can change how the controls are manipulated to achieve the desired
angular velocity.  This is for the Torque PID mentioned above.  Internally,
kOS uses the ship&#8217;s available torque and moment of inertial to dynamically
calculate the PID constants.  Then the desired torque is calculated based on
the desired angular velocity.  The steering controls are then set based on
the the percentage the desired torque is of the available torque.  You can
change the settling time for the torque calculation along each axis:</p>
<div class="highlight-c"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// Increase the settling time to slow down control reaction time and</span>
<span class="c1">// reduce control spikes.  This is helpful in vessels that wobble enough to</span>
<span class="c1">// cause fluctuations in the measured angular velocity.</span>
<span class="c1">// This is recommended if your ship turns towards the target direction well</span>
<span class="c1">// but then oscillates when close to the target direction.</span>
<span class="n">SET</span> <span class="n">STEERINGMANAGER</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">PITCHTS</span> <span class="n">TO</span> <span class="mf">10.</span>
<span class="n">SET</span> <span class="n">STEERINGMANAGER</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">ROLLTS</span> <span class="n">TO</span> <span class="mf">5.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you find that kOS is regularly miscalculating the available torque, you can
also define an adjust bias, or factor.  Check out these <a class="reference internal" href="../../structures/misc/steeringmanager.html#structure:STEERINGMANAGER" title="STEERINGMANAGER structure"><tt class="xref ks ks-struct docutils literal"><span class="pre">SteeringManager</span></tt></a>

PITCHTORQUEFACTOR, YAWTORQUEFACTOR, ROLLTORQUEFACTOR</p>

<div class="section" id="advantages-disadvantages">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Advantages/Disadvantages</a><a class="headerlink" href="#advantages-disadvantages" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The advantage of &#8220;Cooked&#8221; control is that it is simpler to write scripts
for, but the disadvantage is that you have only partial control over
the details of the motion.</p>
<p>Cooked controls perform best on ships that do not rely heavily on control
surfaces, have medium levels of torque, and are structurally stable.  You can
improve the control by placing the ship&#8217;s root part or control part close to the
center of mass (preferablly both).  Adding struts to critical joints (like
decouplers) or installing a mod like Kerbal Joint Reinforcement will also help.</p>
<p>But because of the impossibility of finding one setting that is universally
correct for all possible vessels, sometimes the only way to make cooked
steering work well for you is to adjust the parameters as described above,
or to make your own steering control from scratch using raw steering.</p>
